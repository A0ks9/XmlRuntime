/**
 * **@AutoAttribute Annotation**

 * **Purpose:**
 * This annotation, `@AutoAttribute`, is a custom annotation designed to be used in Kotlin
 * to mark classes or functions for special processing related to attributes or properties.
 *
 * **How it Works (Conceptual):**
 * Annotations in Kotlin (and Java) are a form of metadata. They don't directly execute any code themselves.
 * Instead, they act as markers that can be read and processed by tools during compilation or runtime.
 *
 * In the context of `@AutoAttribute`, it is likely intended to be used with an **annotation processor**.
 * An annotation processor is a separate program (often part of a compiler plugin or build tool)
 * that scans your code during compilation. It looks for annotations like `@AutoAttribute` and, based on
 * their presence, can generate code, perform checks, or trigger other actions.
 *
 * **Possible Use Cases (Hypothetical - Based on the name "AutoAttribute"):**
 *  - **Automatic Attribute Handling:**  An annotation processor could be written to automatically generate code
 *    for handling attributes or properties of a class marked with `@AutoAttribute`. This might involve:
 *      - Generating getter and setter methods.
 *      - Creating boilerplate code for data binding or serialization related to attributes.
 *      - Implementing validation logic for attributes.
 *  - **Configuration for Attribute Processing:**  The `@AutoAttribute` annotation itself could potentially
 *    be extended to accept parameters (e.g., `@AutoAttribute(generateSetters = true, validate = true)`)
 *    to further configure how attributes of the annotated class or function should be processed.
 *
 * **Important:**
 *  - **This annotation alone does nothing.**  It's just a marker. To make it actually *do* something,
 *    you need to create an **annotation processor** that is designed to recognize and handle `@AutoAttribute`.
 *  - **Without an accompanying annotation processor, this annotation is purely declarative.** It serves
 *    as documentation or a signal for other developers or future tools.
 *
 * **Breakdown of the Annotation Definition:**
 *
 * 1. `@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS, AnnotationTarget.FUNCTION)`
 *    - **`@Target`**: This annotation is itself an annotation that specifies where the `@AutoAttribute`
 *      annotation can be applied in your code.
 *    - **`AnnotationTarget.CLASS`**:  Indicates that `@AutoAttribute` can be used to annotate **classes**.
 *       ```kotlin
 *       @AutoAttribute
 *       data class MyDataClass(val name: String, val age: Int) // Applying to a class
 *       ```
 *    - **`AnnotationTarget.FUNCTION`**: Indicates that `@AutoAttribute` can be used to annotate **functions** (methods).
 *       ```kotlin
 *       class MyClass {
 *           @AutoAttribute
 *           fun calculateValue(input: Int): Int { // Applying to a function
 *               return input * 2
 *           }
 *       }
 *       ```
 *    - By specifying both `CLASS` and `FUNCTION`, the `@AutoAttribute` annotation is versatile and can be used
 *      at both class and function levels.
 *
 * 2. `@Retention(AnnotationRetention.SOURCE)`
 *    - **`@Retention`**: This annotation specifies how long the `@AutoAttribute` annotation should be retained
 *      by the Kotlin compiler.
 *    - **`AnnotationRetention.SOURCE`**:  This retention policy means that the `@AutoAttribute` annotation
 *      will **only be available at compile time**.
 *      - The annotation will be present in the source code and will be accessible to annotation processors
 *        during compilation.
 *      - **However, the `@AutoAttribute` annotation will be discarded by the compiler and will *not* be present
 *        in the compiled bytecode (e.g., `.class` files or DEX files).**
 *      - This is a common retention policy for annotations that are primarily used for code generation or
 *        compile-time checks, as they are not needed at runtime.
 *
 * 3. `annotation class AutoAttribute`
 *    - **`annotation class`**: This keyword in Kotlin is used to declare a custom annotation.
 *    - **`AutoAttribute`**: This is the **name** of the annotation you are defining. You will use this name
 *      to apply the annotation in your code (e.g., `@AutoAttribute`).
 *
 * **How to Use (Without an Annotation Processor - Just as a Marker):**
 *
 * If you don't have an annotation processor set up, you can still use `@AutoAttribute` as a marker for
 * your own code or for documentation purposes. For example, you might use it to:
 *
 * 1. **Signal Intent to Other Developers:** Indicate that a class or function is designed to have its
 *    attributes handled in a specific, automated way (even if the automation isn't implemented yet).
 *
 * 2. **Documentation:** Use it as a form of structured documentation to highlight classes or functions
 *    that are related to attribute management.
 *
 * 3. **Future Annotation Processing:**  If you plan to build an annotation processor later, you can start
 *    annotating your code with `@AutoAttribute` now to prepare for that future functionality.
 *
 * **Example Usage (as a marker without processor):**
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * package com.example.myapp
 *
 * import com.dynamic.annotations.AutoAttribute
 *
 * @AutoAttribute // Marking the class for potential automatic attribute handling
 * data class UserProfile(
 *     val userId: String,
 *     var userName: String,
 *     val email: String?
 * )
 *
 * class DataProcessor {
 *     @AutoAttribute // Marking a function related to attribute processing
 *     fun validateUserData(user: UserProfile): Boolean {
 *         // ... validation logic ...
 *         return true
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **In summary, `@AutoAttribute` is a custom annotation that, by itself, doesn't do anything. It's a marker.
 * To make it functional, you need to create an annotation processor that will read this annotation during
 * compilation and perform actions based on its presence.**
